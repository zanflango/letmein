letmein
=======

Minecraft mode for Hypixel VampireZ - let me in command opens near by doors. This command opens any wooden doors in a 5 block radius. It currently also broadcasts a message "Won't you invite me in?" although that could be easily removed. the idea here is to open door that are being clogged up by zombies. The intent was for use in VampireZ as a purchaseable item by the vampires.
